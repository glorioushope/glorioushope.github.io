These were some of the many themes that the participants thought of as they interpreted this year’s theme for the GH 2016 Mid-Run Fellowship, which is “Gear Up for a Breakthrough: Be Transformed from the inside Out”.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>“How has Glorious Hope impacted my life?”</strong></p><p>Accepted.  This was how I felt when I joined Glorious Hope even when I was rejected by my own friends and family.  Nonjudgmental.  This was how my life coaches and my co-participants were as I shared with them the poor decisions I made and the stories that I have kept buried in a dark place so that no one would see them.  Significant.  To the Glorious Hope family, I was, even when my own parents ignored me and told me that I was hopeless.</p><p><br></p><p>More than all these, I felt loved.  I was reminded that the Lord loves me and still, He pursues me in spite of my inadequacy and all my failures.  He used my life coaches to make me feel His love as they patiently and lovingly listened, asked follow-up questions, and helped me in my healing journey.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>“I want in!”</strong></p><p>Due to the comfort that God gave me through Glorious Hope, I was inspired to share the same comfort that I experienced in the Glorious Hope family.  When the paper was being passed on as Glorious Hope asked for volunteers, I didn’t hesitate to sign up.  I know that there are a lot of hurting people out there.  I hope that just like my life coach, I would also be used by God to share the same comfort that He has given me.</p><p><br></p><p>I am joyful that in spite of my imperfections, the Lord has allowed me to serve Him as a life coach in Glorious Hope.  He has given me the privilege to be a part of other people’s lives as they share their stories with me – their hurts, their hearts. More importantly, God has given me the opportunity to share the love and hope that could only come from Him and Him alone.</p><p><br></p><p>To give you a glimpse of our Glorious Hope family, watch the short video of the GH 2016 Mid-Run Fellowship below.</p></div>

Many feel lost, confused, imprisoned by their own bitterness, anger, and resentment.  Many do not know how to cope.  Many do not know the truth that there is hope, that change is possible.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, you know that change is possible.  Now, you know that there is hope in Jesus.  Now, you know that you can make a difference.  You might think, “But I still have so many things going on in my life”.  God is in control.  Still is.  Always is.

My days and nights as a casino dealer drifted away on autopilot until I got suspended.</p><p><br></p><p>In the interim, I applied for a part-time hosting job in an events company. I lacked proper training, was too old and inexperienced but for some reason, I got hired. That day, when the CEO rhetorically asked me and the rest of the hopeful hosts/actors, <em>“What do you want? What do you really, really want?”</em> I knew I wanted the job. I wanted it because it awakened something in me. I wanted it for the joy of bringing a character to life – from a white-faced clown with a plump red nose to a pretty fairy with lovely locks and everything else in between. It mattered to me that I was able to express myself while ushering spectators onto a happy reality. It mattered to me that I was valued for my character, not for what I did.</p><p><br></p><p>When my days of suspension were over, I reported back to the exciting but mechanical reality of the casino grind.</p></div>

                    <p>I was 11, so young, naïve and idealistic, when I first fell in love with teatro. Countless rehearsals birthed in me the dream to pursue a course, if any, on theatre. I wanted the fairy’s role but I wasn’t that pretty and I didn’t know ballet so the director cast me as another character. I must have been very good at it because I was awarded a gold medal for my performance as the animated garbage pile.<br><br>My parents didn’t enroll me in theatre school, but I passed when I auditioned for membership in a university-wide theatre guild. Allow me to say that life, unfortunately, propelled me onto something I didn’t want or aspired for. I pursued a major that I tried hard to be good at because my parents deemed it more job-worthy than pursuing the arts. So today, almost three decades later, I sometimes tend to be unsure of my talents, and of myself.<br></p>

Like when Papa would be away for weeks or even months and I didn’t know when he’ll come back. Or when he didn’t show up for my summer graduation. Those things stayed with me. Well, some happy events in our family stayed with me, too, and those are the ones I hope to remember long enough to tell my own grandchildren.</p></div>

The feeling came back like an old friend: resentment.</p><p><br></p><p>I remember some of his stories and how he sang until I fell asleep. I remember how he very quietly slipped a gift into the tiny Christmas socks on my bedside. I remember how, when I was 12, we scoured the metro just to find a copy of my Science book and he got late for work because of that.</p><p><br></p><p>For me, he was the finest gentleman any girl could ever have for a father. He valued education. He didn’t throw his weight around but carried himself well. He regarded all work with diligence and dignity – from carpentry to finishing an article to creating a blueprint.  Always neatly dressed, he spoke with candor and eloquence that some of his students and colleagues hated him for it.</p><p><br></p><p>I always looked forward to when he would come home from work so I can give him his slippers and he can hand me his pasalubong – even if it was just a few chocolate trinkets.&nbsp;</p></div>

He taught us how to pray and even when he didn’t teach us how to read the Bible, I saw him read it almost daily.<br><br>He’s long been gone but my love for him never waned. His voice, his embrace, the first time he let me sit on his lap when I was 5 and how, a few days before he died he told me over the phone, “Love na love ka ni Papa.” Papa loves you very much.<br><br>I didn’t realize I still resented my mother.

It was from Plymouth (pronounced: plee-muth), my ex-boyfriend.</p><p><br></p><p>Several years ago, before – and even during – Glorious Hope sessions, I would feel angry-sad whenever Ply’s memory, look-alike, namesake (or anything which sounds like Ply’s name) would come up. Last week, however, there was no such emotion. I didn’t feel angry nor sad. I didn’t feel excited either. At best, I’d say I felt amused. It has been 12 years since we broke up so it’s interesting that Ply still remembers me.</p><p><br></p><p>When my life coach asked me to share my answers in the Lesson 1 homework, I realized that there was no more pain in my heart towards Ply. Wow! After four Glorious Hope runs, I can now honestly say that there is no more tinge of guilt in my heart over the sins my ex and I committed together against God and against each other. No more anger towards myself nor Ply. I’ve forgiven Plymouth. I’ve forgiven myself. I’ve moved on. I am healed, I am free!</p><p><br></p><p>Still, I can’t say I’ve already arrived. My journey is far from over. I’m still near the shore. I need to dive, swim deeper and get to the bottom of my dysfunctions – my quirks, attitude problems and crazy-angry episodes. More importantly, I am yet to uncover – or discover – where the murmuring waves of doubt in my heart come from.</p><p><br></p><p>My orange workbook beckons. Same words, different lesson: <strong>WRITE ABOUT IT</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>Writing helps me organize my thoughts and be more objective about my recovery.
